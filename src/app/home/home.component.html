        <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie 
          at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system.  C is the most widely used computer language.
          It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language,
           which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.</p>
        <p>Prerequisites
            Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies.
             A basic understanding of any of the programming languages will help you in understanding the C programming concepts 
             and move fast on the learning track.</p>
        <p><h2>Facts about C</h2>
          <p>C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.</p>
            
          <p>C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.</p>
            
          <p>The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).</p>
            
          <p>The UNIX OS was totally written in C.</p>
            
          <p>Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.</p>
            
          <p>Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.</p>
            
          <p>Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.</p>

        <p>C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs.
           C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. 
           This tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++.
        </p>
        <p>Before you start practicing with various types of examples given in this tutorial,
          we are making an assumption that you are already aware of the basics of computer program and computer programming language.
        </p>
        <p><h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
            C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development −
            
            <p>Encapsulation</p>
           <p> Data hiding</p>
            <p>Inheritance</p>
            Polymorphism
        <p><h2>Learning C++</h2>
            The most important thing while learning C++ is to focus on concepts.
            <br/>
            The purpose of learning a programming language is to become a better programmer; 
            that is, to become more effective at designing and implementing new systems and at maintaining old ones.
            <br/>
            C++ supports a variety of programming styles. You can write in the style of Fortran, C, Smalltalk, etc., 
            in any language. Each style can achieve its aims effectively while maintaining runtime and space efficiency.

        <p>CSS is used to control the style of a web document in a simple and easy way.
            CSS is the acronym for "Cascading Style Sheet". This tutorial covers both the versions CSS1,CSS2 and CSS3,
            and gives a complete understanding of CSS, starting from its basics to advanced concepts.</p>
        <p>A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document. 
          A style rule is made of three parts −<br/>

            Selector − A selector is an HTML tag at which a style will be applied. This could be any tag like  etc.<br/>
            
            Property − A property is a type of attribute of HTML tag. Put simply, all the HTML attributes are converted into CSS properties. They could be color, border etc.<br/>
            
            Value − Values are assigned to properties. For example, color property can have value either red or #F1F1F1 etc.</p>

      <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language
         on Web to develop web pages. HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but 
        "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. 
        HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999.
         Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version 
         which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012.</p>
      <p>Before proceeding with this tutorial you should have a basic working knowledge with Windows or
         Linux operating system,additionally you must be familiar with −<br/>

          * Experience with any text editor like notepad, notepad++, or Edit plus etc.<br/>
          * How to create directories and files on your computer.<br/>
          * How to navigate through different directories.<br/>
          * How to type content in a file and save them on a computer.<br/>
          * Understanding about images in different formats like JPEG, PNG format.</p>
      <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.<br/>

          Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. 
          Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.<br/>
          
          As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" 
          a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.</p>
